Design a modern, minimalistic dashboard for 'ADHD Focus,' using a grey and yellow color palette. The UI should balance calm, neutral tones with vibrant accents to guide users' attention. Key elements should include:

Grey for the background and primary sections to create a sense of calm and focus.
Yellow as an accent color for buttons, progress bars, icons, and highlights to bring vibrancy and call attention to important features.
Subtle shadows and gradients on the cards to make them stand out against the grey background.
Interactive hover effects using yellow for focus states, like on buttons or navigation links.
Use a bold yellow highlight for the navigation bar when hovering over or selecting items.
Incorporate icons in each card (Tasks, Habits, Focus, Mood) with subtle grey outlines and yellow fills for visual engagement.
Implement a light or dark grey toggle for users to switch between two calming themes."
Specific Suggestions with the Grey and Yellow Theme:
Navigation Bar:

Make the background of the navigation bar light grey, with text in dark grey. When hovered, the text or background can change to yellow to make it interactive.
Card Design:

Use light grey for the card background with a subtle shadow to give them some depth.
Add yellow accents like a small line or dot on the top or side of each card.
Icons on the cards can have yellow outlines or fill when hovered.
Add more interactivity to cards with hover effects, like a slight lift or glow in yellow.
Progress Indicators:

For tasks, habits, or focus tracking, use a yellow progress bar against a light grey background.
Circular progress bars for mood tracking can be grey with yellow progress fills.
Buttons and Action Items:

Buttons should have a yellow background with dark grey text. On hover, reverse the colors (yellow text on grey background) for an interactive feel.
Important actions or calls to action, like "Start Timer" or "Add Habit," should use yellow buttons to make them stand out.
Typography:

Keep headings in dark grey to maintain a clean, professional look.
Use yellow sparingly in text, such as for emphasis or key highlights, like completed tasks or successful habits.
Mood Tracking Section:

Mood levels could be represented by yellow smiley faces or icons that fill up based on the user's energy/mood level.
